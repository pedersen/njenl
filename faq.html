<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>What's the point of this game?</dt>
  <dd><p>Each side is struggling to capture the minds of humanity to
  push forward its own goals. To capture the minds, we build fields
  covering the areas where people live and work and play. The fields
  are three portals (sites of special interest for some reason),
  linked together, covering an area. Each side is working to establish
  their fields, and keep their fields established, so as to help
  further their side's goal and bring about their ultimate
  victory.</p>

  <p>This, though, is only part of the game. Many people get to the
  level cap (level 8) and stop, thinking they've done everything there
  is to do. They are missing so much more, as this game has a major
  social component too. People from Russia and Australia have worked
  closely with people from New York City during
  operations. Friendships have been made. Places have been discovered
  that were unknown before. People have learned more about their home
  towns in the year that Ingress has been up than they ever did for
  the years before it became reality.</p>

  <p>It's a game, yes. But it's more than that. It's a way and a
  reason to get out and meet people. We hope you'll join us.</p></dd>
  
  <dt>How do I get started?</dt>
  <dd>First, you have to have the application. You can find it at
  the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress">Play
  Store</a>. Once you install it, sign in, and pick your agent
  name. Choose Enlightened as your faction, and go through the
  training missions. You're now started.</dd>

  <dt>What do I do next?</dt>
  <dd><p>Now, you want to look at
  the <a href="https://www.ingress.com/intel">the intel map</a> for
  your area. It will show you the portals that exist around. Get
  out. Go visit them. Get some gear. Claim some portals. Meet
  people. And, above all else, have fun.</p>

  <p>We recommend doing two other things as well to help you get into
  the game. First, check
  out <a href="http://www.ingressbootcamp.com/">Ingress Boot Camp</a>
  and the <a href="http://ingressfieldguide.com/">Ingress Field
  Guide</a>. It has many more tips for getting started, along with
  strategy guides and information about the back story of the
  game. Second, check out our <a href="/communities.html">New Jersey
  communities</a>. In there, you will find some locals who will be
  happy to help you in a number of ways. They really are your best
  resource.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Getting Gear</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>How do I get gear?</dt>
  <dd><p>There are two methods to get gear. The first (and most
  preferred) is to hack portals. Hack every single one of them. If you
  are hacking an enemy portal, you will get gear and AP (which helps
  you level up faster). If you hack your own faction's portal, you get
  slightly more gear (usually). To hack a portal, click on it on your
  scanner, and then click &quot;Hack&quot;.</p>

  <p>The second method is a gear drop. Find
  someone <a href="communities.html">local to you</a>, and ask them
  for gear. Frequently, they will be happy to help you out. Even if
  they can't, they can usually point you to someone who will help you
  out.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Getting AP (How To Level Up)</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>How can I gain more AP?</dt>
  <dd><p>At the lowest levels, taking down enemy portals can be very
  difficult. Gaining enough AP to go up can seem impossible. The best
  thing to do if you wish to rise rapidly is to contact
  someone <a href="communities.html">local to you</a>, and ask them
  for help. They'll take down enemy portals, leaving them grey for you
  to capture. Once you've started capturing portals, make links
  between them. This will give you still more AP. Once you're able to
  establish links among a group of portals, you'll make fields, which
  give you still more AP. Later, you'll be able to take down enemy
  portals with ease, allowing you to gain still more AP entirely on
  your own.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> If you have someone clearing enemy portals for you,
  listen to their advice about links to make. They'll help you make
  the most fields possible, which will result in your getting the
  biggest AP gain possible.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Capturing Portals</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>How do I capture a neutral (grey) portal?</dt>
  <dd>Once you have found the portal, go stand near to it. There is a
  ring around your avatar on the screen. Try to get the edge of that
  ring as close to the center of the portal as possible, and hit
  deploy. That will space the resonators out as far as possible,
  making it harder for someone else to take it down.</dd>

  <dt>How do I capture an enemy (blue) portal?</dt>
  <dd>You will need XMPs to take down an enemy portal. XMPs have range
  that is affected by their level: The higher the level, the farther
  away they will do real damage. When starting out, the best thing to
  do is to move around until you are standing on the resonator, and
  then fire your XMPs. Long press on the screen until the menu comes
  up, and then click &quot;Fire XMP&quot;. Select the XMP, then press
  and hold the &quot;Fire&quot; button until the white ring collapses
  in the center. Release it then for an attack bonus of 20%. If you
  release too soon, you will still get an attack bonus, just not the
  maximum 20%.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>The Social Game</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>How do I talk to other players?</dt>
  <dd><p>The game itself provides a mechanism. When running, there is a
  tab at the bottom of the screen labeled &quot;COMM&quot;. Tap that,
  and a window slides up with three tabs: &quot;All&quot;,
  &quot;Faction&quot;, and &quot;Alerts&quot;. If you are talking to a
  faction mate, make sure to use only the Faction tab. It's mildly
  more secure than All (both sides, sadly, have players with one
  Enlightened account and one Resistance account, with the alternate
  account used for spying). If you want to talk to them more securely,
  then you're going to need to use something like instant messaging or
  email. Most Ingress players use Google+ and Hangouts for
  communication, and we recommend it.</p>

  <p>When using the in game Comm system, send a message to a specific
  player by using an @ in front of their name. For instance,
  &quot;@Shadowfall hello&quot; will send that message to Shadowfall
  regardless of where he is. Since distances can matter very much, we
  recommend using an @mention whenever possible.</p></dd>

  <dt>How do I meet other players?</dt>
  <dd><p>For most people, that's easy: Simply ask them in comms to
  meet. Use a public place, like a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, or Wawa, or
  pub. Do all the usual safe meeting practices you would do for
  meeting someone for the first time, then go there, say hi, and swap
  stories. They want to meet you just as much as you want to meet
  them, especially if they're higher level players. We are all
  stronger when we are a team, and including lower level players is
  something the higher level players very much want to do.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> If they do not wish to meet, do not try to force
  it. That is against the terms of service (as it is harassment) and
  could get you banned.</p></dd>

  <dt>How do I verify the identity of other players I have never met?</dt>
  <dd>Verifying the identity of other players is fairly easy, but time
  consuming. We recommend following the steps posted
  by <a href="http://bit.ly/ingressverification">ShadowFall</a> to do
  it.</dd>

  <dt>How do I know who I can trust if I never meet them?</dt>
  <dd>Trust is actually a very hard thing to do. Sometimes, you might
  find yourself needing to trust someone half a world away, and have
  no way of verifying you should. You can verify that their identity
  on Google+ is the owner of the agent name on Ingress, but how can
  you tell that they are a legitimate player, and not a double
  account? To do that, you have to network yourself, and talk to more
  and more people from farther and farther away. Introduce yourself,
  get others to introduce you, and keep plugging away. But that will
  only help the other side know you. How will you know them? Only via
  the chain of introductions. There's nothing better than that.</dd>
