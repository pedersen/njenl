<p>Welcome to the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_(game)">Ingress</a>. Ingress is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">Alternate Reality Game</a> (ARG) in which two factions (named Enlightenment and Resistance) are engaged in a secret war to determine the future of the human race.</p>

<p>We are the Enlightened of New Jersey. We have heard the promise of the Shapers, and we have responded in force. We work to bring the benefits of XM not just to ourselves, not just to the people in our area, but to the entire world. We struggle against the fearful minds of the Resistance. They are incapable of imagining a better future. The battle is not easy. The Resistance is strong. We are organized, but organization is not enough. We need more people.</p>

<p>We need you. Every new recruit makes us stronger. We will show you the ropes, teach you how to play the game, teach you how to be effective, and help you level up as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>Join us.</p>

<p>Together, we will shape the world.</p>
